    <h3>노래 가사:</h3>
    <h5>
What if, what if we run away?<br>
What if, what if we left today?<br>
What if we said goodbye to safe and sound?<br>
And what if, what if we're hard to find?<br>
What if, what if we lost our minds?<br>
What if we let them fall behind and they're never found?<br>
And when the lights start flashing like a photobooth<br>
And the stars exploding, we'll be fireproof<br>
My youth, my youth is yours<br>
Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls<br>
My youth, my youth is yours<br>
Runaway now and forevermore<br>
My youth, my youth is yours<br>
A truth so loud you can't ignore<br>
My youth, my youth, my youth<br>
My youth is yours<br>
My youth is yours<br>
My youth is yours<br>
My youth is yours<br>
What if, what if we start to drive?<br>
What if, what if we close our eyes?<br>
What if we're speeding through red lights into paradise?<br>
'Cause we've no time for getting old<br>
Mortal body, timeless souls<br>
Cross your fingers, here we go<br>
Oh oh oh oh<br>
And when the lights start flashing like a photobooth<br>
And when the lights start flashing, flashing, flashing<br>
And when the lights start flashing<br>
My youth, my youth is yours<br>
Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls<br>
My youth, my youth is yours<br>
Runaway now and forevermore<br>
My youth, my youth is yours<br>
A truth so loud you can't ignore<br>
My youth, my youth, my youth<br>
My youth is yours<br>
My youth is yours<br>
My youth is yours<br>
My youth is yours<br>
    </h5>
